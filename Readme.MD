# Getting Started with Machine Learning

I've divided this repository in 3 main folders initially:

  * notebooks (Jupyter Notebooks)
  * programs (Specific to Scikit Learn, Tensorflow, Keras and Common)

## Basic Requirements

Make sure you have following installed on your system:

  * Anaconda (for python and required dependencies)
  * Scikit Learn
  * Tensorflow

## Steps to get started with Machine learning

You can get started with Jupyter notebooks under notebooks/learning folder
